Q4

Consider an array, 
A, whose contents is integer values. Given a particular threshold value 
t, an event 
E between indices 
i<j is a critical event if a_i>tâˆ—a_j.

In this problem, write a full program that outputs the number of critical events for an arbitrary array of integers and any arbitrary threshold value 
t
t.
